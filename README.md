## Missing Features / Work in Progress
This mockup is **not entirely finished**. Some missing parts include:

1. Only one product page exists – currently, only Boba Mochi has a dedicated product page.
2. No hyperlinks in plots – I haven’t figured out how to add clickable links to the chart bars, so for now, links are only available in Employees' Picks and View Past Weeks' Results.
3. "View More Past Weeks" not implemented - the button is present but does not yet load additional results.
